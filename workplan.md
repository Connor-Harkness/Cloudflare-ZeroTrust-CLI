# Workplan: Cloudflare ZeroTrust CLI Tool

## Overview

Design and implement a CLI tool in Node.js to manage all aspects of Cloudflare ZeroTrust, focusing primarily on tunnels and related resources (such as public hostnames). The CLI will use the official Cloudflare API library for interaction with Cloudflare services.

---

## 1. Requirements Gathering

- [ ] Research Cloudflare ZeroTrust APIs (Tunnels, Public Hostnames, etc.).
- [ ] Identify core use-cases:
  - [ ] Create, list, update, and delete tunnels.
  - [ ] View and manage tunnel details (public hostnames, connections, status).
  - [ ] Manage related resources (e.g., access rules, certificates).
- [ ] Understand authentication requirements (API tokens, scopes).

---

## 2. CLI & Project Design

- [ ] Define CLI command structure:
  - `zerotrust tunnel list`
  - `zerotrust tunnel create`
  - `zerotrust tunnel delete`
  - `zerotrust tunnel show <id>`
  - `zerotrust tunnel hostname list <tunnel>`
  - `zerotrust tunnel hostname add/remove`
- [ ] Plan for flexible output (table, JSON, YAML).
- [ ] Include global flags (API token, account ID, debug, etc.).
- [ ] Plan help and documentation system.
- [ ] Choose CLI framework for Node.js (e.g., Commander.js, oclif, yargs).

---

## 3. Project Structure

- [ ] Setup basic project scaffolding:
  - CLI entrypoint (e.g., bin/zerotrust.js).
  - Command definitions (commands/ directory).
  - Cloudflare API client wrapper using the official library.
  - Config and credential management.
  - Error handling and logging.
- [ ] Use the official Cloudflare Node.js API library.

---

## 4. Implementation

- [ ] Implement configuration and authentication system.
- [ ] Build API client for Cloudflare ZeroTrust endpoints.
- [ ] Implement core commands:
  - [ ] List tunnels
  - [ ] Show tunnel details
  - [ ] Create tunnel
  - [ ] Delete tunnel
  - [ ] List and manage public hostnames
- [ ] Add support for additional resources (access rules, etc.).
- [ ] Implement output formatting options.

---

## 5. Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for API client and commands (use Jest or similar).
- [ ] Integration tests with real API (if possible).
- [ ] CLI command tests.
- [ ] Test for invalid input, error handling, and permission errors.

---

## 6. Documentation

- [ ] Write usage guides and command help.
- [ ] Add examples for common tasks.
- [ ] Document authentication setup.

---

## 7. Release

- [ ] Build and package CLI for major platforms (npm package, standalone binaries via pkg or similar).
- [ ] Create installation instructions.
- [ ] Tag and release v1.0.0.

---

## 8. Maintenance & Future Work

- [ ] Collect user feedback.
- [ ] Add support for new ZeroTrust features as released by Cloudflare.
- [ ] Improve UX (autocomplete, interactive prompts).
- [ ] Add support for config profiles and scripting.
